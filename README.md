# Project Title 
POC for a jdbc based spring project for generating dynmaic json against sql
# Description
This project is a proof of concept for a Spring-based application that uses JDBC to execute SQL queries and generate dynamic JSON responses. The application is designed to demonstrate how to integrate SQL execution with JSON generation in a Spring environment.
The application uses a simple REST controller to handle HTTP requests, executes SQL queries against a database, and returns the results as JSON. It is intended to be a starting point for more complex applications that require dynamic SQL execution and JSON responses.
# Features
- Spring Boot for easy setup and configuration
- JDBC for database interaction
- Dynamic JSON generation based on SQL query results
- RESTful API for accessing the functionality
- Simple and clean code structure for easy understanding and extension
